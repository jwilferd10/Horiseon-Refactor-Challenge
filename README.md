## :wave: Description: 
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.

Horiseon was a pregenerated web-page for my first challenge within the UCLA Coding Bootcamp, this project simulated an on-the-job ticket centered around refactoring an existing site to increase accessibility. As such, semantic HTML elements have been added and the CSS has been consolidated for easy use. Additionally the structure of the HTML now follows a more logical structure, alt attributes have been added to each image, and the headings follow a sequential order.

The base project ended at commit 768dd21. Anything after are changes I've made post bootcamp, my goal is to add visual improvements and to make Horiseon a more mobile friendly application. 

## :book: User Story:
**AS A marketing agency**
- I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
    - SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

**GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards**
- WHEN I view the source code
    - THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    - THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the image elements
    - THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes
    - THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element
    - THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
